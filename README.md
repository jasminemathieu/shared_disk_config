## Introduction

This project covers the installation and configuration process of LAMP stack collection process. This LAMP stack is comprised of four programs - Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, used to create and deploy a functional database application. 

### Components used to complete this project:

- Azure
- Microsoft Virtual Machines
- Data Disk

## Successful Restore Confirmation
I was able to remote into the machine and confirm the restore machine duplication was successful.

we were able to successfully add the E file but we are not able to few our test file 'shared drive'

Let's run a configuration in Azure on the shared disk to enable it's accessibility to multiple machines. Ensure all machines are off connected to the data disk and select yes. Save this setting.

## Conclusion
In this project, I was able to successfully configure and complete a full cloud-native backup service and machine restore to 100% data availability in Azure. Both methods prove to be powerful on-premises data protection solutions, useful in events of service disruptions, accidental deletions or corruption of data. It's equally secure, scalable, and cost-effective as it is simple to architect, highly available, and resilient.
